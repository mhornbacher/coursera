# Coursera Code

This code represents my submissions to coursera (in version control since 2023).

## 🕰️ History

Most of this code was done in 2017 when I just started learning programming. Please don't judge me too harshly for it 🤣. As such most of this code is not clean and strongly advised not to be used as a guide, for cheating or in production. This exists publicly because of the "why not" principle.
